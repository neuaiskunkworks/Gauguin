# Gauguin Visualizing the Abstract and Symbolic


Post-Impressionism has an emphasis on more symbolic content, formal order, and structure. The idea is to create a picture that reflects the essence of something. This is a research oriented sub-project interested in creating novel visualizations and extending existing graphs and algorithms to visualize abstract ideas like bias or confounders in data. 

These novel visualizations are part of a python library called Gauguin.

For OPT people, your challenge will be to propose a method of visualizing bias and write a design document for its implementation.
