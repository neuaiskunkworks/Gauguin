# Gauguin.ai


 The Gauguin.ai website the website is intended and a portal and community for those interested in data visualization research.
 
* It should look a little like the New York Times crossed with 538.     
* It should allow users to publish Medium style article.    
* It should also have a kind of article called a "wiki article". This means that the author will originally write an article but then allow others to edit and extend it.  
* It should house the Data Journalism Database.  
* It should have Yelp like reviews of data visualization tools.  
* It should have a database of data visualization freelancers and professionals.  
* It should have a database of data sources.  
* It should have a database of data visualization conferences and journals.   
* The front page should be a newsfeed and recommended articles. This should be personalized if a user logs-in.  
* All articles should be auto-tagged (classified) according to a glossary of data visualization jargon.  


For OPT people, your challenge will be to replicate the Skunks.ai site to begin the redesign.  The Skunks.ai and Gauguin.ai web teams so be aware of what the others are doing so that functionality developed for one can be used for the other.


If an OPT person is accepted they will split their time between Skunks.ai and Gauguin.ai as needed.  See [http://skunks.ai/](http://skunks.ai/)
