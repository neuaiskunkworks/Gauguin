# Gauguin Designer


For GauguinDesigner the idea is to use a data set and a target or an existing graphic and have the tool make design suggestions.

One idea is to use a data set and a target and possibly other tuneable latent variables and use GANs to generate and rank "design sketches" for visualization. That is, to use GANs to suggest interesting visualization designs that can be replicated more precisely using the Gauguin library once a design is decided.

Another area of research is to allow one to upload an image and get critique on the type of graph chosen, font, color, etc,

Another area of research is to allow one to upload an image and find similar images from the Data Journalism Database ranked by the quality of the related images. 

For OPT people, the challenge will be to use GANS to generate one of the following chart types :  Arc Diagram, Area Graph, Bar Chart, Box & Whisker Plot, Brainstorm, Bubble Chart, Bubble Map, Bullet Graph, Calendar, Candlestick Chart, Chord Diagram, Choropleth Map, Circle Packing, Connection Map, Density Plot, Donut Chart, Dot Map, Dot Matrix Chart, Error Bars, Flow Chart, Flow Map, Gantt Chart, Heatmap, Histogram, Illustration Diagram, Kagi Chart, Line Graph, Marimekko Chart, Multi-set Bar Chart, Network Diagram, Nightingale Rose Chart, Non-ribbon Chord Diagram, Open-high-low-close Chart, Parallel Coordinates Plot, Parallel Sets, Pictogram Chart, Pie Chart, Point & Figure Chart, Population Pyramid, Proportional Area Chart, Radar Chart, Radial Bar Chart, Radial Column Chart, Sankey Diagram, Scatterplot, Span Chart, Spiral Plot, Stacked Area Graph, Stacked Bar Graph, Stem & Leaf Plot, Stream Graph, Sunburst Diagram, Tally Chart, Timeline, Timetable, Tree Diagram, Treemap, Venn Diagram, Violin Plot, and Word Cloud.

One person should choose one of the graph types above.  No replication. Once chosen that programmer has a graph type, another engineer wishing to take the challenge must choose one of the graph types above not already chosen.
