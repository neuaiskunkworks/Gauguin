# Gauguin

_Gauguin - Open-source Post-impressionist Data Visualization_ 

Gauguin is a project with five objectives:

1. To automate EDA - to create a python based AutoEDA tool similar to the many AutoML frameworks where a user uploads some data, selects a target of interest
and the tool creates thousands of visualizations giving insight into the data ranked by interestingness.

This is part of a python library called Gauguin.

The projects details are in the Gauguin folder.

2. Post-Impressionism has an emphasis on more symbolic content, formal order, and structure. The idea is to create a picture that reflects the essence of something. This is a research oriented sub-project interested in creating novel visualizations and extending existing graphs and algorithms to visualize abstract ideas like bias or confounders in data. 

These novel visualizations are part of a python library called Gauguin.

The projects details are in the GauguinViz folder.

3. Gauguin Bot and Data Journalism Database - to create a python based bot to gather social media data visualizations.

The web bot will find data visualizations and their data sources and annotate them. A neural network will be used to classify images according to their type.

The types of graphs classified will start with Arc Diagram, Area Graph, Bar Chart, Box & Whisker Plot, Brainstorm, Bubble Chart, Bubble Map, Bullet Graph, Calendar, Candlestick Chart, Chord Diagram, Choropleth Map, Circle Packing, Connection Map, Density Plot, Donut Chart, Dot Map, Dot Matrix Chart, Error Bars, Flow Chart, Flow Map, Gantt Chart, Heatmap, Histogram, Illustration Diagram, Kagi Chart, Line Graph, Marimekko Chart, Multi-set Bar Chart, Network Diagram, Nightingale Rose Chart, Non-ribbon Chord Diagram, Open-high-low-close Chart, Parallel Coordinates Plot, Parallel Sets, Pictogram Chart, Pie Chart, Point & Figure Chart, Population Pyramid, Proportional Area Chart, Radar Chart, Radial Bar Chart, Radial Column Chart, Sankey Diagram, Scatterplot, Span Chart, Spiral Plot, Stacked Area Graph, Stacked Bar Graph, Stem & Leaf Plot, Stream Graph, Sunburst Diagram, Tally Chart, Timeline, Timetable, Tree Diagram, Treemap, Venn Diagram, Violin Plot, and Word Cloud.

See [https://datavizcatalogue.com/](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) for descriptions of these graphs.

Visual Techniques such as small multiples, 3D, interactive, video, animation, dashboard, etc. will annotated.

Further the colors used, negative space, data to ink ratio, position along a common scale, positions along nonaligned identical scales, length, area, volume, shading, color saturation, direction, angle, curvature, font, leading, etc will be annotated.  

The database will be open-source and available as a data dump and well as searchable and browsable via the Gauguin.ai site.

The projects details are in the GauguinBot folder.

4. Gauguin.ai website - the website is intended and a portal and community for those interested in data visualization research. 

The projects details are in the Gauguin.ai folder.


5. GauguinDesigner - the idea is to use a data set and a target or an existing graphic and have the tool make design suggestions.

One idea is to use a data set and a target and possibly other tuneable latent variables and use GANs to generate and rank "design sketches" for visualization. That is, to use GANs to suggest interesting visualization designs that can be replicated more precisely using the Gauguin library once a design is decided.

Another area of research is to allow one to upload an image and get critique on the type of graph chosen, font, color, etc,

Another area of research is to allow one to upload an image and find similar images from the Data Journalism Database ranked by the quality of the related images. 


The projects details are in the GauguinDesigner folder.
