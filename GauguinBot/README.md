# Gauguin Bot and Data Journalism Database

The idea is to create a python based bot to gather social media data visualizations.

The web bot will find data visualizations and their data sources and annotate them. A neural network will be used to classify images according to their type.

The types of graphs classified will start with Arc Diagram, Area Graph, Bar Chart, Box & Whisker Plot, Brainstorm, Bubble Chart, Bubble Map, Bullet Graph, Calendar, Candlestick Chart, Chord Diagram, Choropleth Map, Circle Packing, Connection Map, Density Plot, Donut Chart, Dot Map, Dot Matrix Chart, Error Bars, Flow Chart, Flow Map, Gantt Chart, Heatmap, Histogram, Illustration Diagram, Kagi Chart, Line Graph, Marimekko Chart, Multi-set Bar Chart, Network Diagram, Nightingale Rose Chart, Non-ribbon Chord Diagram, Open-high-low-close Chart, Parallel Coordinates Plot, Parallel Sets, Pictogram Chart, Pie Chart, Point & Figure Chart, Population Pyramid, Proportional Area Chart, Radar Chart, Radial Bar Chart, Radial Column Chart, Sankey Diagram, Scatterplot, Span Chart, Spiral Plot, Stacked Area Graph, Stacked Bar Graph, Stem & Leaf Plot, Stream Graph, Sunburst Diagram, Tally Chart, Timeline, Timetable, Tree Diagram, Treemap, Venn Diagram, Violin Plot, and Word Cloud.

See [https://datavizcatalogue.com/](https://datavizcatalogue.com/) for descriptions of these graphs.

Visual Techniques such as small multiples, 3D, interactive, video, animation, dashboard, etc. will annotated.

Further the colors used, negative space, data to ink ratio, position along a common scale, positions along nonaligned identical scales, length, area, volume, shading, color saturation, direction, angle, curvature, font, leading, etc will be annotated.  

The database will be open-source and available as a data dump and well as searchable and browsable via the Gauguin.ai site.

For OPT people, the challenge will be to generate automatically thousands of images for two of the following graph types:  Arc Diagram, Area Graph, Bar Chart, Box & Whisker Plot, Brainstorm, Bubble Chart, Bubble Map, Bullet Graph, Calendar, Candlestick Chart, Chord Diagram, Choropleth Map, Circle Packing, Connection Map, Density Plot, Donut Chart, Dot Map, Dot Matrix Chart, Error Bars, Flow Chart, Flow Map, Gantt Chart, Heatmap, Histogram, Illustration Diagram, Kagi Chart, Line Graph, Marimekko Chart, Multi-set Bar Chart, Network Diagram, Nightingale Rose Chart, Non-ribbon Chord Diagram, Open-high-low-close Chart, Parallel Coordinates Plot, Parallel Sets, Pictogram Chart, Pie Chart, Point & Figure Chart, Population Pyramid, Proportional Area Chart, Radar Chart, Radial Bar Chart, Radial Column Chart, Sankey Diagram, Scatterplot, Span Chart, Spiral Plot, Stacked Area Graph, Stacked Bar Graph, Stem & Leaf Plot, Stream Graph, Sunburst Diagram, Tally Chart, Timeline, Timetable, Tree Diagram, Treemap, Venn Diagram, Violin Plot, and Word Cloud.

One person should choose two of the graph types above.  No replication. Once chosen that programmer has those graph types, another engineer wishing to take the challenge must choose two of the graph types above not already chosen.
